    <h2>About me:</h2>
    <p>
      Hi! My name is Yubo(Brenner) Wang, and I’m currently a junior student studying in Computer Science at Texas A&M University. 
      My interest in technology started early, when I first began exploring algorithms and C++ programming in middle school. 
      Since then, I’ve expanded my skills into areas such as web development, data structures, and digital systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      My technical background includes proficiency in C++, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Vue. 
      I enjoy building efficient solutions, whether it’s through coding, designing systems, or analyzing complex problems. 
      Looking ahead, I am especially interested in exploring <strong>game development</strong>, combining my creativity with 
      my technical expertise to create engaging and interactive experiences.
    </p>
    <p>Some of my hobbies are: <strong>Video Games</strong>, <strong>Video editing</strong>, <strong>Powerlifting</strong></p>
    <p>
      All that being said, <strong>Welcome to my Personal Website!</strong>, feel free to explore around!!!
