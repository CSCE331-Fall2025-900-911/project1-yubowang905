      <h2>About me:</h2>
      <p>
      Hi! My name is Yubo(Brenner) Wang, and I’m currently a junior student studying in Computer Science at Texas A&M University. 
      My interest in technology started early, when I first began exploring algorithms and C++ programming in middle school. 
      Since then, I’ve expanded my skills into areas such as web development, data structures, and digital systems. I enjoy 
      building efficient solutions, whether it’s through coding, designing systems, or analyzing complex problems. 
      <br><br>
      Beyond technical skills, I value collaboration and creativity. I’ve learned that some of the best solutions 
      come from working with others, exchanging ideas, and approaching problems from different perspectives. I enjoy 
      applying what I know to practical challenges, and I’m always curious about learning new tools, frameworks, and ways 
      to improve my craft.
      <br><br>
      Some of my hobbies include playing video games, video editing, and working out, 
      which help me balance technical work with creativity and personal growth. 
      All that being said, welcome to my personal website — feel free to explore around!
