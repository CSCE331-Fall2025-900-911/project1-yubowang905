      <h2>About me:</h2>
      <p>
      Hi! My name is Yubo(Brenner) Wang, and I’m currently a junior student studying in Computer Science at Texas A&M University. 
      My interest in technology started early, when I first began exploring algorithms and C++ programming in middle school. 
      Since then, I’ve expanded my skills into areas such as web development, data structures, and digital systems. I enjoy building efficient solutions, whether it’s through coding, designing systems, or analyzing complex problems. 
      <br><br>
      Beyond technical skills, I value collaboration and creativity. I’ve learned that some of the best solutions 
      come from working with others, exchanging ideas, and approaching problems from different perspectives. I enjoy 
      applying what I know to practical challenges, and I’m always curious about learning new tools, frameworks, and ways 
      to improve my craft.
