      <h2>About me:</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! My name is Yubo (Brenner) Wang, and I’m currently a junior student studying Computer Science at Texas A&amp;M University.
        My interest in technology started early, when I first began exploring algorithms and C++ programming in middle school. 111
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then, I’ve expanded my skills into areas such as web development, data structures, and digital systems.
        I enjoy building efficient solutions—whether it’s through coding, designing systems, or analyzing complex problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond technical skills, I value collaboration and creativity. I’ve learned that some of the best solutions come from working
        with others, exchanging ideas, and approaching problems from different perspectives. I’m always curious about new tools,
        frameworks, and ways to improve my craft.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of my hobbies include playing video games, video editing, working out, reading and musics, which help me balance technical work with
        creativity and personal growth.
        All that being said, <strong>Welcome to my Personal Website!</strong> — feel free to explore around!

        <strong>Video Games</strong><br/>
        I love both competitive games like Valorant and cooperative games like Destiny 2. Gaming is both a hobby and a way I stay
        connected with my friends and communities.

        <strong>Video Editing</strong><br/>
        I enjoy creating fun edits, highlights, and short stories through video. It’s a creative outlet that blends tech with storytelling.

      <p>
        <strong>Working Out</strong><br/>
        Strength training and discipline through lifting are part of my routine. It teaches persistence and goal-setting outside of academics.
