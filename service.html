      While I don't have much experiences in using my technical skills to service people or communities
      around me, below here are some of the services/experiences I have. I believe these experiences highlight
      my personality, demonstrate how I work with people and most importantly, my passion in doing what I like.

        <h3>Destiny 2 Free Sherpa</h3>
        <p>Destiny 2 is one of my favorite video games and ever since I started playing it, 
        it has been known for its enthusiastic community. Back in the days when I was a beginner, I met many nice players, 
        who were always patient and willing to help out other players. As part of this awesome community, I contribute to it 
        by doing "sherpa" activities weekly. I coach new players, help out players struggling with missions, provide guidance 
        for those just started playing, etc.</p>

        <h3>Deman Esport Club Manager</h3>
        <p>Deman Esport Club is the biggest esport/gaming community of Chinese people 
        here in North America. As an international student, I met many friends and had lots of fun times in this community 
        during the early years when I got here. It definitely helped me to adapt to new environemnt, getting great help 
        and advices, and meeting new people. I hope this community gets to help more people and maintain its original purpose,
        which is why I worked to become one of its managers. I host activities, deal with players conflicts, and try my best 
        to make sure everyone gets an awesome experience here.</p>
